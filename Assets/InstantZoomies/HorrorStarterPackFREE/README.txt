SETUP INSTRUCTIONS: 

1)	In your project folder, navigate to: 
   	Assets > InstantZoomies > HorrorStarterPackFREE > Packages

2)	Double click the .unitypackage file that applies to your project's render pipeline and press import.
	
3)	Open the demo scene located at:
	Assets > InstantZoomies > HorrorStarterPackFREE > Scenes

4)	Press the play button to view your new assets!

---------------------------------------------

NOTE: There is an example texture that shows where to put the image you would like to appear in the picture frame.
The texture is located at:

	Assets > InstantZoomies > HorrorStarterPackFREE > Textures > Example_PictureFrame

We've put the Instant Zoomies logo in the texture to show you the correct position. 

---------------------------------------------

TROUBLESHOOTING:

If the prefabs in the demo scene appear pink, you may have imported the wrong package. 
Return to step 1 and try again. You do not need to delete any files or folders beforehand.
